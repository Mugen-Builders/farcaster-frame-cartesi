## Frames for Cartesi rollup dApps [WIP]

Frames are tiny meta-apps within Farcaster client(like Warpcast). You can literally turn your post(aka cast) into an interactive app. Frames can work as UI for triggereing advance request on your Cartesi backend.

This project is a fork of https://github.com/Zizzamia/a-frame-in-100-lines

### Steps to run

1. Clone this repo
2. Modify `config.ts` 
3. Customize - Buttons and Images
4. Deploy to Vercel
5. Test the frame on [Warpcast frames validator](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames).
